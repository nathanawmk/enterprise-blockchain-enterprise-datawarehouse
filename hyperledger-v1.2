What is New in HL v1.2
Hyperledger v1.2 (HL v1.2) is truly, truly an exciting release. I have been long awaiting for this release as it addresses some of the challenges I personally encountered when using Fabric. Many, including myself, have shared these challenges with the Hyperledger Fabric team and we are heard. Before I share the full list of exciting new features in HL v1.2, some context is first needed. 

Context 
Privacy and Scalability are the foremost reasons why organisations choose permissioned/consortium blockchains/DLTs over the public ones. 

With Hyperledger, privacy is enabled through the use of channels. The channel design is elegant and it works. For Enterprise Ethereum, specifically Quorum, private transactions are introduced thus creating 2 states – public state and private state. 

After much industry experimentation with Hyperledger, one of the most commonly heard feedback is over the v1 channels design. To take one example, SWIFT completed a POC over and one of the observation/findings was “…to productise the solution, more than 100,000 channels would need to be established and maintained, covering all existing Nostro relationships, presenting significant operational challenges.”

In Hyperledger v1.2, all these issues were addressed head on. 

High-Level Features in HL v1.2
Some of the highlights rolled out in HL v1.2 are:
1.	

Not to worry if these terms are new to you as a primer is provided below. 

Fundamentals First – Definitions
Channel: 
A channel is a private blockchain overlay which allows for data isolation and confidentiality. Channels are defined by a Configuration-Block.

Channel-specific Ledger: 
A channel-specific ledger is shared across the peers in the channel, and transacting parties must be properly authenticated to a channel in order to interact with it

Private Data Collections: 
Used to manage confidential data that two or more organizations on a single channel want to keep private from other organizations on that channel. The collection definition describes a subset of organizations on a channel entitled to store a set of private data, which by extension implies that only these organizations can transact with the private data.

Private Data:
Confidential data that is stored in a private database on each authorized peer, logically separate from the channel ledger data. Access to this data is restricted to one or more organizations on a channel via a private data collection definition. Unauthorized organizations will have a hash of the private data on the channel ledger as evidence of the transaction data. Also, for further privacy, hashes of the private data go through the Ordering-Service, not the private data itself, so this keeps private data confidential from Orderer.

There you have it! A hyperledger v1.2 fabric on which can be further built upon. 

When to Use Collection within a Channel or a Separate Channel
1.	Use channels when entire transactions (and ledgers) must be kept confidential within a set of organizations that are members of the channel. For example, …

2.	Use collections when transactions (and ledgers) must be shared among a set of organizations, but when only a subset of those organizations should have access to some (or all) of the data within a transaction. Additionally, since private data is disseminated peer-to-peer rather than via blocks, use private data collections when transaction data must be kept confidential from ordering service nodes. For example, …

Conclusion
Being both a Hyperleder/Enterprise Ethereum DLT practitioner in the finance industry within the capital markets, the introduction of private data collection in v1.2 release is a real, real game changer: Instead of creating multiple separate channels among participants to achieve privacy needs, you need only to create one channel to keep chaincode data confidential among a subset of channel members.

Speaking from personal experience, having to evaluate and actually building and operating DLT solutions in production environment/setting that can scale, private data collection in v1.2 release really, really makes scaling up and operating a lot easier.
